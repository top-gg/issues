# DiscordBotList Issues

Thanks for reporting an issue you are facing. By that you help us and the community making DiscordBotList a better place for everyone.

Before you file an issue, please consider these simple rules:

- Do not reopen an issue
- Your content should be explicit and spot on the issue
- Follow the Discord ToS just as in the Discord Server or the DiscordBotList Website
- Stay constructive, even if a discussion seems to get heated

Currently there are the following templates to submit an issue:

1. [General Issue](https://github.com/DiscordBotList/issues/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
2. [Bug Report](https://github.com/DiscordBotList/issues/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)

Please pick one of these accordingly and then head over to [issues](https://github.com/DiscordBotList/issues/issues) and file your report.

## Rating a Report or a Comment

We appreciate every contribution - even if it's just up- or down-voting an issue or comment.
Please do so by adding :thumbsup: or :thumbsdown:. Alternatively you may react to an existing one.

## Discussing a Report

If you have more to say than just "I agree" or "I disagree" feel free to comment on an issue. By doing so you can show up new perspectives and get a discussion going. That is tremendously helpful when it comes down to deciding which issue is worth a fix and comming up with a solution.

For discussing the same rules count as for posting an issue. Please stick to them, especially staying constructive and friendly.
